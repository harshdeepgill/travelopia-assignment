## BEM Architecture
The CSS architecture used in this project follows the Block Element Modifier (BEM) methodology. BEM is a naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS that promotes a modular and reusable approach. It consists of three parts:

- **Block:** The main component or container.
- **Element:** A part of the component that performs a particular function.
- **Modifier:** A variation or state of the block or element.

BEM helps maintain a clear and scalable codebase, making it easier to understand and extend stylesheets.
